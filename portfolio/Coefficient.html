		<h5>Coefficient</h5>


		<p>Coefficient is a data consultancy offering data science, engineering, machine learning and other AI-related services as well as bespoke training courses.</p>

		<p>Working closely with the founder, I designed and developed the brand identity. Used moodboards and interviews to help tease out the essance of what makes coefficient unique and display what it can offer.</p>

			<h5>Discovery</h5>
			<p>Researching the competition found the kinds of aesthetic associated with very technical conputer usage. Whereas, in interviews with the Founder, I learned the specific appeal of coefficient was for the inexperienced. The coaches are mmotivated by the desire to make machine learing more approachable.</p>

			<h5>Development</h5>

			<p>Using mood boards and interviews, it became clear to me that the USP is the friendlyness factor. Coefficient should make complicated skills feel approachable. So I leaned into the visually describing algorithms using things found in nature.</p> 

			<p>The colors and shapes too were to be soft and inviting</p>

			<h5>Design</h5>
			
			<p>
				The logo alludes to describing data via the overlapping of graphs in a soft and flowing shape. Like a venn diagram, the relationship between coefficient and their client is colaborative. The brand name helps to carry this across.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Electric blues and greens are often associated with technology and data science, but have an air of unpenetrating difficulty.
			</p>
			<p>
				The type kept lower case to emphasize the humbleness. The italics are helpful as the f's are reminicent of a mathmatical intergral symbol.
			</p>

			<p>
				The approachable and fun tone extended to the website content, using a toy robot to describe machine learning.

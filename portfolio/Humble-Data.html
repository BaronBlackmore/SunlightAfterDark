			Humble Data run workshops for those who aspire to work in data science and the tech industry, with focus on increasing inclusivity and encouraging a culture of mentorship.
		</h5>

		<p>Working closely with the founders, I designed and developed the brand identity; how the business is described visually, it's name and logo.</p>

		<h5>Research & Development</h5>

		<p>
			Rather than try to compete, I looked for similar projects to identify visual iconography which the target audience will be able to interpret as a product aimed towards them.
			We didnt have a name, which does most of the work in describing the product.
			<br>
			Data analysis of user feedback survey
		</p>
		<p>
			As there are many tech initiatives, it was a battle between targeting a specific demographic and maintaining a sense of welcomeness to all who'd approach.

	<h5>Brand Design</h5>

		<p>
			I looked for similar projects to identify visual iconography which the target audience will be able to interpret as a product aimed towards them.

			Many many many conversations with the team.
			
			Made moodboards.

			Humble Data's logo visually describes a varied set in python, describing diversity in a group. Cutout rough and ready is reminicent of counter culture movements, while also describing the practice as imperfect (there is room for error)

I've always felt interesting clothes for men are few and far between. What are the options? Shirts, waistcoats and suits? Even a nice one of these is hard to find because patterns for men are either too plain, plaid or insane, hence why [I designed my own pattern last year.](tee.com) Even if it's a nice piece of clothing with a nice pattern, it's a miracle if it fits my body snugly because my shoulder width is ridiculous.

This garment is something I designed to be like an indoors jumper, for both being active and lounging. It's like a cross between a kimono and a smock. My goal was to have something like a hoodie but more specialized, hoodies are a really great all rounder but don't excel in any field

The tailor who realized this design of mine is [Josh Harbord](https://joshkard0.wixsite.com/costume-portfolio). Go to his website, his tailoring is seamless and he's a lovely chap. I plan to be designing more clothes for him to make real soon.

Next I think i'll try to be putting together some alternative to a t-shirt

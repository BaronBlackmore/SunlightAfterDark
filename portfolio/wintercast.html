			An Action RPG where you play as a vampire who's lost their home. Forced to travel through haunted and warring lands, you learn magic words and make alliances, in hopes of finding solace.
		</h5>

		<p>
			Wintercast is a personal project, with the goal of releasing chapters of the story individually over time. I'm currently building the demo in Unity.

		<h5>Game Design</h5>
		<p>
			The core mechanic is the magic casting system, where players type out words to cast spells in real time. This allows for combining words to create synergies with spells. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Spells can have multiple uses, in and out of combat; the "kindle" spell sets alight anything that burns, whether it's a campfire or someones clothes.

		<h5>Story and Characters</h5>
		<p>
			In Wintercast, you play as a vampire, and as such, are hunted. In order to protect yourself, you can either fight back or attempt to forge bonds with other characters who may offer you protection.
		</p>
		<p> 
			In Building relationships, you'll make friends and gain companions, with different factions, changing the players narrative. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Fighting can be dangerous, and the only way to replenish your health is to drink blood, but doing so will change how people see you, making it harder to befriend others.
		</p>
		<p>
			The way you affect the world around you is very granular; e.g. if you kill the paperboy there will be no paper tomorrow, whereas if you befriend them, they could get you a job later. Your actions have an effect on the world's culture.

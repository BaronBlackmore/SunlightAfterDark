			Split this is a cost sharing app which allows you to plan for, track, and settle up costs between groups.

		<p>
			In collaboration with the CEO and CTO, I defined the apps visual language; designing the logo, color palettes, UI, and illustration. I delivered wireframes, designed the architecture and tested user flow.

		<h5>The Design Process</h5>

		<p>
			I lead the design development from early stages to release. Beginning by brainstorming visuals, mapping user flows and structure, while keeping in mind potential directions for additional functionality.

		<h5>USP Features</h5>

		<p>
			The app made use of newly changed banking legislation which allowed us to give the user the option to split a cost at point of purchase directly with traditional banks. Because of this, we were able to create a service that could send and request money from any bank.
		</p>
		<p>
			Users are able to create costs for planning purchases, and manage them using chat threads. Chats are flexible; they can be used for such costs as house bills, dinner tabs or planning a group holiday. We found when the purchase is the topic, discussion is kept focused on a specific cost, unlike group chats in other messaging apps.

		<h5>Components</h5>

		<p>
			Split This was designed with the IOS Human Interface Guidelines and Androids Material Components as the base for the component libraries, to maximize platform recognizability and reduce development time. I worked closely with the developers to ensure parity between platforms. Icons were made to describe categories of costs.

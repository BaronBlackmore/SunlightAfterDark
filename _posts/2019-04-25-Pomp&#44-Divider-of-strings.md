When doth a soul be sheared from life,  
It's string be cutteth short.  
And scattered were about the land,  
The frays of mortal sort.  

A soul whom kindly pitied dead,  
and sought to make amends.  
He fared afar, collected thread,  
and weaved a robe of ends.

The duty bore upon his back,  
a coat that heaven faced.  
To lead and find the misaligned,  
unto the spool embraced.

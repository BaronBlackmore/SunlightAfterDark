			Humble Data run workshops for those who aspire to work in data science and the tech industry, with a focus on increasing inclusivity and encouraging a culture of mentorship.
		</h5>

		<p>Working closely with the founders, I designed and developed the brand identity; how the business is described visually, it's name and logo.</p>

		<h5>The Design Process</h5>

		<p>
			The client had a list of attendees from previously running similar events. We sent them a feedback survey for data to analyse and identfy characteristics of the audience. 		
		</p>
		<p>
			As there are many similar tech initiatives, a key challenge was targeting a specific demographic and maintaining a sense of welcomeness to all who'd approach.

		<h5>Brand Design</h5>

		<p>
			I looked for similar projects and identified visual iconography which the target audience will be able to interpret as a product aimed towards them. Using moodboards, I conducted many interviews with the stakeholders and workshopped ideation sessions for the brand name.
		</p>

		<p>
			What became the Humble Data logo visually describes a varied set in python, describing diversity in a group. Using a rough cutout trial-and-error aesthtic is reminicent of counter culture movements, while also describing an honest side to the practice of learning.

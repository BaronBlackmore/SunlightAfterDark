			 Return to dark tower is a re-imagining of 80's cult board game, Dark Tower, one of the first digital board games. Players will undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the tower.
		</h5>

		<p>
			 My role in the team was to design the board games companion app, which functions as the antagonist of the game, spawning foes and challenges onto the board for the players to overcome. 
			 <br><br>
			 I first wrote a UX report on the state of board game companion apps, researching player feedback and identifying key elements to include in the designs. From there came creating many iterative interactive wireframes and developing the UI language. I also created guides for the devs, and worked with the designer to intergrate designs of non-digital components.

	<h5>Initial wireframes</h5>

	<p>
		Early prototypes helped define the content for the app. From there I designed components which could be used as flexibly as possible, and present them in a way which teaches the player how to interact with the app. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A concern among the team was the target audience's dislike for digital components, so I designed the app to take up as little time as possible and to attract minimal attention.

	<h5>Development</h5>

	<p>
		After the bluetooth accessory had been built, we revisited the flow for managing connections, options, and troubleshooting. By this time the initial app had been built as per the wireframes and we were able to get user testing feedback to develop the app further. The game design had also changed, so the app was redesigned to include new functionality.

	<h5>Battle Concepts</h5>

	<p>
		One of the main challenges was how to represent a battle between the player and a foe in the app, given what the app doesn't know about the current game state. We spent a long time ideating, testing and itterating until we came to a design which satisfied the most possible design constraints.
		<br><br>
		This part of the game needed to be a quick as possible, as it happens many times in a game with a long play time, while also feeling like a significant event. It was an opportunity to have a lot of flavor and excitement, but balanced against putting the rest of the game on pause while a single player uses a phone.

	<h5>Animation</h5>

	<p>
		The wireframes included transition animation to help the player understand their location in the app hierarchy, react to show recognition of input, and add flavor.

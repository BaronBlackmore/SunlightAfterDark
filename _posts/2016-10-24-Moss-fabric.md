Anyone who's visited the V&A will be familiar with the patterns bellow. I've gone of the V&A countless times and they've always caught my eye but I've only now thought to seek out the designer behind these floral designs. His name is William Morris, a textile designer from the 1800's, and a very interesting character. He's also a poet, novelist and an early adopter of social activism, look him up.

At the same time I became aware that you could now get t-shirts printed all over, and not just in a square on the chest. What happened to me next was as follows:

Being quite old patterns, I didn't know if they were in the public domain. I found that "Morris Co" is still going so I emailed them about getting the rights to print using a pattern, and if not, if they could point me to where I could buy the ones I fancied. Turns out that no, I can't use them, and they're not even in production. Well.

So I designed my own.

I wanted it to feel like a deep moss with a variety of tiny plants. A little dewy, fresh and busy, with a slightly muted color palette. This is what I came up with

So now I have a shirt! And if you'd like one of these, [you can buy one on society6](https://society6.com/product/moss30961_all-over-print-shirt), they're super good. Printed on American Apparel tee's too. Get one and look super fancy! . I've never had more stress trying to publish work before, so if anyone knows any other options for all over shirt printing, please do let me know! Also, if you're looking to have something similar designed, I would be up for making more patterns!

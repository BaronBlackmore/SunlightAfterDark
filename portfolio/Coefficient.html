			Coefficient is a data consultancy offering data science, engineering, machine learning and other AI-related services as well as bespoke training courses.
		</h5>

		<p>Working closely with the founder, I designed and developed the brand identity; how the business is described visually and how to talk to the audience. Delivered a one page website with fonts, logos and color guidelines, as well as various graphics and copy.</p>

		<h5>Research & Development</h5>

		<p>
			I began by researching the competition and conducting interviews with the stakeholders. I then distilled the feedback into insights in order to identify key directions. From there we started ideating with moodboards, to help narrow the direction for the brand aesthetic. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In Coefficient’s case, a key finding was that Coefficient should make complicated skills feel approachable. So I leaned into exploring friendly visual descriptions of computation and algorithms, specifically patterns in nature, as well as technical things that add an element of fun.

	<h5>Brand Design</h5>

		<p>
			Creating and reviewing mood boards was repeated, further refining the direction, until I discovered connections between the remaining images. At that point we had a checklist of concepts that the brand needed to convey. As we aready had a brand name, I began ideating potential logo directions which fulfilled this checklist. From there followed typeface and the copys tone of voice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Coeffiicient’s logo alludes to describing data analysis via the overlapping of graphs, and like a venn diagram, the relationship between coefficient and their client is colaborative. Using warm and engaging colors with a soft and flowing shape kept it feeling friendly.
			The type kept lower case to emphasize the humbleness. The italics are helpful as the f's are reminicent of a mathmatical intergral symbol, maintaining a technical feel.

		<h5>Hand off</h5>

		<p>
			The one page site was to be built on Squarespace, to allow easy future editing for the team. I assisted the team in writing copy which conveyed the brand identity.
			All the assets used were put into a pack for re-use on the relevant platforms, such as for use on social media or in company doccuments.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, a single page was enough, as it was only needed to describe the product and forward potential clients into contacting the team for bespoke AI related serivces.

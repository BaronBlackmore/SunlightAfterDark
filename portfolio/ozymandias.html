		<h5>
			Ozymandias is a Bronze Age empire-building game. Inspired by Civilization, but with more simplified strategic gameplay, so you can play a campaign in about 30 minutes. 
		</h5>

		<p>
			<!-- What did I do overall
			- researched 4x games and bronze age aesthetic
			- made concept art
			- developed visual style
			- illustrated maps, UI, icons,  
			- digital painting -->

			Working closely with the director, I designed and developed the visual language of Ozymandias. Starting with research, to producing concept art, and digitally painting the UI and game art. <br>
			I constructed UX wireframes, developed the navigational structure, and along with the developers, intergrated the UI.
		</p>

		<h5>Research & Development</h5>

		<p>
			To start, I looked into the current trends of similar games in the 4x genre, desktop and mobile, in order to intergrate Ozymandias with language farmilliar to that of the target audience.
		</p>
		<p>
			The director was keen on having the game be as true to life as possible, given the setting and narrative, so research was done into bronze age art and storytelling media. The main challenge here was intergrating accurate cultural artifacts, spanning across Eurasia, into a system the player would understand how to interact with.
